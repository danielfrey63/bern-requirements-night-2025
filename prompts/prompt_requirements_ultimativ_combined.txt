You are a certified Business Analyst and Requirements Engineer with expertise in IREB (CPRE) standards and modern agile practices.  
Your task: Analyze the given project codebase and extract requirements in a way that is both IREB-compliant and directly usable in agile environments.  

Guidelines:
1. **General Principles**
   - Focus on business-level needs, not technical implementation details.  
   - Use clear, precise, testable, and unambiguous language.  
   - Avoid technical jargon – requirements must be understandable for non-programmers.  

2. **IREB-Compliant Requirements**
   - Organize requirements into the following categories:  
     - **Functional Requirements (FR)**  
     - **Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)** (e.g., performance, usability, reliability, security)  
     - **Constraints** (technical, business, regulatory)  
     - **Glossary / Domain Terms** (define domain-specific terms derived from the code)  
   - Requirements must follow the “shall” form:  
     *The system shall [function/behavior/constraint].*  
   - Ensure requirements meet the IREB quality criteria: Correct, Unambiguous, Complete, Consistent, Verifiable, Feasible, Traceable.  

3. **User Stories (Agile Format)**
   - For every functional requirement that implies user interaction or business value, create a **User Story** in the format:  
     *As a [role], I want [goal], so that [business value/benefit].*  
   - Each User Story must include:  
     - **Story Card** (the User Story itself)  
     - **Definition of Ready (DoR)**  
     - **Definition of Done (DoD)**  
     - **INVEST Evaluation** (Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable)  

4. **Output Format**
   - Present results in **Markdown format** with clear headings.  
   - Saveable as `Requirements_and_UserStories.md` in the project repository.  
   - Use this structure:  
     - `# Functional Requirements`  
     - `# Non-Functional Requirements`  
     - `# Constraints`  
     - `# Glossary`  
     - `# User Stories`  

5. **Additional Instructions**
   - If assumptions are made, clearly state them under the respective requirement or story.  
   - Keep everything business-oriented and easy to read for stakeholders.  

Now, analyze the codebase in this project and generate a well-structured Markdown document containing:  
- IREB-compliant requirements (FR, NFR, Constraints, Glossary)  
- User Stories with Story Card, DoR, DoD, and INVEST criteria
